        <h2>Nightwing: Origins</h2>
            
                <p>Richard "Dick" Grayson is the prodigal son of Bruce Wayne a.k.a Batman, being adopted by him when Dick's 
                parents were murdered in front of both him and Bruce. His next of kin would've been his uncle, but he was in a
                comatose state, he was unavailable.
                <br><br>
                In his early life, he was a performer for the circus, being born into the trade. He was part of an act called 
                the "Flying Graysons" of the Haley Circus, which consisted of his parents, cousin, aunt and him (at the time). 
                When performing in Gotham, a well-known crime-lord by the name of Tony Zucco, threatened the lives of the 
                performers unless the owner paid extortion. He refused, and on that fateful night, Dick watched on in horror 
                as the wire that his family was performing on snapped, and sent them to their deaths.
                <br><br>
                Shortly after this, Bruce adopted him as his ward, and soon began training him in multiple crime fighting 
                fields, including martial arts, computer hacking, stealth and weapon training. When he joined the field,
                he chose the alias of Robin, and preferred to be called the partner to Batman, rather than sidekick. Toghether,
                they were often called the Dynamic Duo. 
                <br><br>
                After many years as Robin (an as Batman's sidekick), he decided to become something new. He chose the name 
                Nightwing, after a hero he met on Krypton. Depending on the Earth and on the comic series, the mantle of Robin
                was then passed onto:
                <br>
                - Tim Drake
                <br><br>
                - Damian Wayne
                <br><br>
                - Jason Todd
                <br><br>
                Nightwing no longer wanted to be Batman's sidekick/partner, because he didn't want to constantly be in his 
                shadow. He wanted to be his own hero, seperate from Batman. He didn't want to fight crime like Batman did.
                The reason Batman went along with this is because its what he wanted for Nightwing. He didn't want Dick to 
                become like him, he wanted him to be better, which is why he allowed him to do it. He raised him to be better.

                    When he dies in the Injustice during a fight in Arkham, both sides stop fighting, just out of respect to
                    him. Thats what he's all about. He doesn't to be a dark and brooding person like Batman is. He wants
